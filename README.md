# My Portfolio Website

I built this website to share my projects and thoughts with you. I love working on deep learning and web development projects.

## What's on My Site

- **About Me**: Learn about my background and interests through the sliding sidebar
- **My Projects**: Check out my top coding projects with links to GitHub
- **My Blog**: Read my articles on AI and programming topics

## Featured Blog: Understanding Autoencoders

My main blog post is all about autoencoders - a fascinating type of neural network. What makes this blog special:

- **Interactive Diagrams**: Play with sliders to see how autoencoders work
- **Visual Learning**: Watch data flow through the network in real-time
- **Simple Explanations**: I break down complex math into understandable concepts
- **Hands-on Examples**: See actual code examples you can try yourself

I created interactive visualizations using D3.js and Chart.js to help you understand these concepts better than static images could.

## My Projects

I've included several of my GitHub projects on the site:
- FitAI: A fitness app using AI
- Data Structures & Algorithms: My implementations
- Real Estate Search System
- Terminal-based Text Editor
- And more!
